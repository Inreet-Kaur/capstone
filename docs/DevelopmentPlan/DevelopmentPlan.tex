This document will provide details about various essential aspects of our development plan. It covers information about critical areas such as confidential information, IPs, and copyright considerations ensuring compliance with ethical standards and regulatory requirements. In addition to this, we will outline team meetings communication plans, and team member roles. We will include a workflow plan that describes how we plan to use Git and GitHub projects for workflow plans and project decompositions and scheduling. Moreover, we have incuded a proof-of-concept demonstration plan along with the technology stack and coding standards we wish for the development of our project. Finally, we will reflect on our learning from this exercise and include a team charter that defines our goals, expectations, and decision-making strategy. 

\wss{Additional information on the development plan can be found in the
\href{https://gitlab.cas.mcmaster.ca/courses/capstone/-/blob/main/Lectures/L02b_POCAndDevPlan/POCAndDevPlan.pdf?ref_type=heads}
{lecture slides}.}

\section{Confidential Information?}

Our project would not use any confidential data and information from the industry. We plan to use publicly available data in the development of this application, ensuring there is no breach of confidentiality.

\section{IP to Protect}

There is no IP to protect this project at the current stage. All work during the development phase will be original and no existing patents or proprietary technologies are involved. 

\section{Copyright License}

\wss{What copyright license is your team adopting.  Point to the license in your
repo.}

\section{Team Meeting Plan}

\wss{How often will you meet? where?}

\wss{If the meeting is a physical location (not virtual), out of an abundance of
caution for safety reasons you shouldn't put the location online}

\wss{How often will you meet with your industry advisor?  when?  where?}

\wss{Will meetings be virtual?  At least some meetings should likely be
in-person.}

\wss{How will the meetings be structured?  There should be a chair for all meetings.  There should be an agenda for all meetings.}

\section{Team Communication Plan}

\wss{Issues on GitHub should be part of your communication plan.}

\section{Team Member Roles}
 
The team would have the following distribution of administrative roles.

\begin{itemize}
\item Project Leader: Pranav Kalsi
\begin{itemize}
\item Prepare agenda for team meetings, ensuring all relevant topics are covered and goals are clear
\item Assign issues on the Kanban board, tracking the progress of each task and redistributing work if needed
\item Act as a liaison between the group and instructional team
\end{itemize}

\item Notetaker: Gurleen Kaur
\begin{itemize}
\item Record meeting minutes and attendance during team meetings
\item Assist in updating the Kanban board based on meeting outcomes
\end{itemize}

\item Communication Laison: Moamen Ahmed
\begin{itemize}
\item Organize team meetings and send reminders to all team members
\item Schedule meetings with external stakeholders
\end{itemize}

\item Administrator: Inreet Kaur
\begin{itemize}
\item Submit Deliverables on the avenue and ensure they meet the requirements
\item Maintain project documentation and files
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize} 

The team will remain flexible for the following roles, with responsibilities subject to change based on the needs of each deliverable and the final project:

Meeting Chair: This role will rotate between team members. The chair will organize and lead meetings, ensuring that the agenda is followed, and discussions stay focused.

Reviewer: The team plans to distribute each milestone evenly among the team members. Each team member’s work will be reviewed by at least two other team members. The reviewer will update issues on GitHub with appropriate comments.

Subject researcher: During a deliverable team members may be assigned to gather information about the industry, their processes, and information about the technology used in development. This role will shift based on individual expertise.

By adopting a flexible approach to the following roles, we want to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to lead and adapt their role according to the project’s needs. Regular check-ins during the team meetings will allow the team to reassess the roles and redistribute tasks as needed. 


\section{Workflow Plan}

We will utilize Git as our version control throughout this project. Here is a detailed breakdown of how we collaborate using different features on GitHub. 

\begin{itemize}
\item Branches: We will create different branches related to each task or issue. 
\begin{itemize}
\item Main branch: The main branch will have a stable production-ready code. 
\item Feature branches: All features will be added through their separate branches.
\item Documentation branches: Each team member will create their branch when working on a particular documentation task. 
\end{itemize}

\item Pull requests: Once the changes are made to a particular branch, team members will create a pull request to merge them into the main branch. Each commit should include a brief description of the changes and related issue numbers of the Kanban board.

\item Issue tracking: The team will utilize the Kanban board under projects for issue tracking. The team will use the provided templates for the appropriate issues and create its own where needed. 
\end{itemize}

The team will be using the following projects:

\begin{itemize}
\item Metrics: This project will be used to record metrics such as attended lectures and team meetings. It has two types of Issues lecture meetings and team meetings and uses the appropriate templates provided. Each team member adds their own attendance and updates team meeting notes as per their assigned roles.
\item Documentation: This project is used to create issues for each assigned task related to project documentation. Each issue will be reviewed by at least two other team members. Each issue uses a customized documentation template and is classified based on different milestones of project documentation. 
\item Development workflow: This project will be used to record issues for different features, feature enhancement, bug fixes, and other needs of the project. The issues will be divided into the above-listed categories and will use customized templates for each. 
\end{itemize}

CI/CD: Pranav

\section{Project Decomposition and Scheduling}

The team will utilize Kanban Board Projects for Issue tracking with four different stages of an issue: ‘To Do’, ‘In Progress’, ‘Review’, and ‘Done’. The team will create different issues for features, bugs, documentation, team meetings, lecture meetings and other things as needed using appropriate templates. The team will create templates for features, bugs and documentation. Issues under different projects will be classified into different milestones with appropriate deadlines. This will help us to track our progress for major milestones in the project. 

Project Links:
\begin{itemize}
\item  
\href{https://github.com/users/Inreet-Kaur/projects/4}{Metrics}
\item  
\href{https://github.com/users/Inreet-Kaur/projects/2}{Documentation} 
\item 
\href{https://github.com/users/Inreet-Kaur/projects/6}{Development workflow}
\end{itemize}

Here is a general process that our team will follow to work on each issue. The team leader will create different issues under the ‘To do’ section and assign them to different team members as discussed during team meetings. Once the changes have been made the team members can now move the issue under the ‘Review’ tab and assign it to other members. The reviewers will provide appropriate comments and suggested changes and move the issue to the ‘In progress’ section if needed. Each issue will be reviewed by at least two other team members. Once the final changes are approved, the issue will now be moved to the ‘Done’ section. 

Each project will be scheduled according to the deadlines outlined in the course outline. The documentation project will have a separate milestone for each deliverable mentioned in the course outline along with the appropriate deadline. The metrics project will track all the team meetings, lecture attendance, and other metrics required throughout the course. We will create an issue for each lecture and each team meeting with the required details in the template. The development project will be classified into different milestones throughout this course. Some stages include initial feature planning, Phase 1 which includes developing core functionalities, including voice recording and chart filling, and Phase 2 which includes developing additional features like the analytical dashboard, triage integration etc. Each phase will have separate issues for feature development, bug fixes, enhancement, and final reviews. 

\section{Proof of Concept Demonstration Plan}

What is the main risk, or risks, for the success of your project?  What will you
demonstrate during your proof of concept demonstration to convince yourself that
you will be able to overcome this risk?

\section{Expected Technology}

\wss{What programming language or languages do you expect to use?  What external
libraries?  What frameworks?  What technologies.  Are there major components of
the implementation that you expect you will implement, despite the existence of
libraries that provide the required functionality.  For projects with machine
learning, will you use pre-trained models, or be training your own model?  }

\wss{The implementation decisions can, and likely will, change over the course
of the project.  The initial documentation should be written in an abstract way;
it should be agnostic of the implementation choices, unless the implementation
choices are project constraints.  However, recording our initial thoughts on
implementation helps understand the challenge level and feasibility of a
project.  It may also help with early identification of areas where project
members will need to augment their training.}

Topics to discuss include the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item Specific programming language
\item Specific libraries
\item Pre-trained models
\item Specific linter tool (if appropriate)
\item Specific unit testing framework
\item Investigation of code coverage measuring tools
\item Specific plans for Continuous Integration (CI), or an explanation that CI
  is not being done
\item Specific performance measuring tools (like Valgrind), if
  appropriate
\item Tools you will likely be using?
\end{itemize}

\wss{git, GitHub and GitHub projects should be part of your technology.}

\section{Coding Standard}

\wss{What coding standard will you adopt?}
