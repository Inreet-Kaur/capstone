This document will provide details about various essential aspects of our development plan. It covers information about critical areas such as confidential information, IPs, and copyright considerations ensuring compliance with ethical standards and regulatory requirements. In addition to this, we will outline team meetings communication plans, and team member roles. We will include a workflow plan that describes how we plan to use Git and GitHub projects for workflow plans and project decompositions and scheduling. Moreover, we have incuded a proof-of-concept demonstration plan along with the technology stack and coding standards we wish for the development of our project. Finally, we will reflect on our learning from this exercise and include a team charter that defines our goals, expectations, and decision-making strategy. 

\wss{Additional information on the development plan can be found in the
\href{https://gitlab.cas.mcmaster.ca/courses/capstone/-/blob/main/Lectures/L02b_POCAndDevPlan/POCAndDevPlan.pdf?ref_type=heads}
{lecture slides}.}

\section{Confidential Information?}

Our project would not use any confidential data and information from the industry. We plan to use publicly available data in the development of this application, ensuring there is no breach of confidentiality.

\section{IP to Protect}

There is no IP to protect this project at the current stage. All work during the development phase will be original and no existing patents or proprietary technologies are involved. 

\section{Copyright License}

\wss{What copyright license is your team adopting.  Point to the license in your
repo.}

\section{Team Meeting Plan}

\wss{How often will you meet? where?}

\wss{If the meeting is a physical location (not virtual), out of an abundance of
caution for safety reasons you shouldn't put the location online}

\wss{How often will you meet with your industry advisor?  when?  where?}

\wss{Will meetings be virtual?  At least some meetings should likely be
in-person.}

\wss{How will the meetings be structured?  There should be a chair for all meetings.  There should be an agenda for all meetings.}

\section{Team Communication Plan}

\wss{Issues on GitHub should be part of your communication plan.}

\section{Team Member Roles}

\wss{You should identify the types of roles you anticipate, like notetaker,
leader, meeting chair, reviewer.  Assigning specific people to those roles is
not necessary at this stage.  In a student team the role of the individuals will
likely change throughout the year.}

\section{Workflow Plan}

We will utilize Git as our version control throughout this project. Here is a detailed breakdown of how we collaborate using different features on GitHub. 

\begin{itemize}
\item Branches: We will create different branches related to each task or issue. 
\begin{itemize}
\item Main branch: The main branch will have a stable production-ready code. 
\item Feature branches: All features will be added through their separate branches.
\item Documentation branches: Each team member will create their branch when working on a particular documentation task. 
\end{itemize}

\item Pull requests: Once the changes are made to a particular branch, team members will create a pull request to merge them into the main branch. Each commit should include a brief description of the changes and related issue numbers of the Kanban board.

\item Issue tracking: The team will utilize the Kanban board under projects for issue tracking. The team will use the provided templates for the appropriate issues and create its own where needed. 
\end{itemize}

The team will be using the following projects:

\begin{itemize}
\item Metrics: This project will be used to record metrics such as attended lectures and team meetings. It has two types of Issues lecture meetings and team meetings and uses the appropriate templates provided. Each team member adds their own attendance and updates team meeting notes as per their assigned roles.
\item Documentation: This project is used to create issues for each assigned task related to project documentation. Each issue will be reviewed by at least two other team members. Each issue uses a customized documentation template and is classified based on different milestones of project documentation. 
\item Development workflow: This project will be used to record issues for different features, feature enhancement, bug fixes, and other needs of the project. The issues will be divided into the above-listed categories and will use customized templates for each. 
\end{itemize}

CI/CD: Pranav

\section{Project Decomposition and Scheduling}

\begin{itemize}
  \item How will you be using GitHub projects?
  \item Include a link to your GitHub project
\end{itemize}

\wss{How will the project be scheduled?  This is the big picture schedule, not
details. You will need to reproduce information that is in the course outline
for deadlines.}

\section{Proof of Concept Demonstration Plan}

What is the main risk, or risks, for the success of your project?  What will you
demonstrate during your proof of concept demonstration to convince yourself that
you will be able to overcome this risk?

\section{Expected Technology}

\wss{What programming language or languages do you expect to use?  What external
libraries?  What frameworks?  What technologies.  Are there major components of
the implementation that you expect you will implement, despite the existence of
libraries that provide the required functionality.  For projects with machine
learning, will you use pre-trained models, or be training your own model?  }

\wss{The implementation decisions can, and likely will, change over the course
of the project.  The initial documentation should be written in an abstract way;
it should be agnostic of the implementation choices, unless the implementation
choices are project constraints.  However, recording our initial thoughts on
implementation helps understand the challenge level and feasibility of a
project.  It may also help with early identification of areas where project
members will need to augment their training.}

Topics to discuss include the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item Specific programming language
\item Specific libraries
\item Pre-trained models
\item Specific linter tool (if appropriate)
\item Specific unit testing framework
\item Investigation of code coverage measuring tools
\item Specific plans for Continuous Integration (CI), or an explanation that CI
  is not being done
\item Specific performance measuring tools (like Valgrind), if
  appropriate
\item Tools you will likely be using?
\end{itemize}

\wss{git, GitHub and GitHub projects should be part of your technology.}

\section{Coding Standard}

\wss{What coding standard will you adopt?}

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

\wss{Not required for CAS 741}

\input{../Reflection.tex}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Why is it important to create a development plan prior to starting the
    project?
    \item In your opinion, what are the advantages and disadvantages of using
    CI/CD?
    \item What disagreements did your group have in this deliverable, if any,
    and how did you resolve them?
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{External Goals}

\wss{What are your team's external goals for this project? These are not the
goals related to the functionality or quality fo the project.  These are the
goals on what the team wishes to achieve with the project.  Potential goals are
to win a prize at the Capstone EXPO, or to have something to talk about in
interviews, or to get an A+, etc.}

\subsection*{Attendance}

\subsubsection*{Expectations}

\wss{What are your team's expectations regarding meeting attendance (being on
time, leaving early, missing meetings, etc.)?}

\subsubsection*{Acceptable Excuse}

\wss{What constitutes an acceptable excuse for missing a meeting or a deadline?
What types of excuses will not be considered acceptable?}

\subsubsection*{In Case of Emergency}

\wss{What process will team members follow if they have an emergency and cannot
attend a team meeting or complete their individual work promised for a team
deliverable?}

\subsection*{Accountability and Teamwork}

\subsubsection*{Quality} 

\wss{What are your team's expectations regarding the quality
of team members' preparation for team meetings and the quality of the
deliverables that members bring to the team?}

\subsubsection*{Attitude}

\wss{What are your team's expectations regarding team members' ideas,
interactions with the team, cooperation, attitudes, and anything else regarding
team member contributions?  Do you want to introduce a code of conduct?  Do you
want a conflict resolution plan?  Can adopt existing codes of conduct.}

\subsubsection*{Stay on Track}

\wss{What methods will be used to keep the team on track? How will your team
ensure that members contribute as expected to the team and that the team
performs as expected? How will your team reward members who do well and manage
members whose performance is below expectations?  What are the consequences for
someone not contributing their fair share?}

\wss{You may wish to use the project management metrics collected for the TA and
instructor for this.}

\wss{You can set target metrics for attendance, commits, etc.  What are the
consequences if someone doesn't hit their targets?  Do they need to bring the
coffee to the next team meeting?  Does the team need to make an appointment with
their TA, or the instructor?  Are there incentives for reaching targets early?}
