\section{Introduction}

\wss{You can include your definition of what a hazard is here.}

\section{Scope and Purpose of Hazard Analysis}

\wss{You should say what \textbf{loss} could be incurred because of the
hazards.}

\section{System Boundaries and Components}

To identify potential hazards, we first define the system boundaries and break it down into its major components:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{User Interface:}
    The user interface is the point of interaction between the users and the system. It is responsible for displaying outputs from the system, such as patient data, medication suggestions, diagnosis predictions etc. The UI plays a crucial role in ensuring a user-friendly and intuitive experience for the users.
    

    Potential Hazards:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item User errors: incorrect data input or misinterpretation of displayed data
        \item Inadequate feedback when errors occur
        \item Incorrect data displayed to the user
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Data Layer:}
    The data layer in the system is responsible for managing and processing all data related to patient records, healthcare professionals, health networks, and predictive models for medication and diagnosis. It is divided into the following databases:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item DB1: Patient, Healthcare Professional, and Network Database: This database stores patient records, healthcare professionals, and healthcare network profiles. This component is responsible for storing, retrieving, updating, and deleting data. 

        \item DB2: Diagnosis Prediction Database: This database stores the data used by the diagnosis prediction component to suggest potential diagnoses based on analysis of the transcribed data.

        \item DB3: Medication Prediction Database: This database holds the data used by the medical prediction component to suggest appropriate medications based on the identified or accepted diagnosis.
    \end{itemize}

    Potential Hazards:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Accidental deletion of database entries or the entire database
        \item Creation of duplicate records
        \item Security breaches
        \item Database crashes   
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{API Module (OAuth):}
    This component securely connects different parts of the system using OAuth authentication. It verifies the identity of users and services before allowing them to access protected resources. The module manages the OAuth process, including user authentication, issuing access tokens, and validating these tokens for each request.
    
    Potential Hazards:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Failed connection between components
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{User Authentication:}
    This component verifies and validates user credentials for secure system access. It implements multi-factor authentication and integrates with the system's cryptographic infrastructure. The component also handles password security and implements measures against unauthorized access attempts.
    
    Potential Hazards:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item User cannot log in to the system
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Account Management:}
    This component oversees user account lifecycles within the system. It handles account creation, profile updates, and account deletion, ensuring data integrity throughout these processes.
    
    Potential Hazards:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Account cannot be created, updated, or deleted
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Report Generating Module:}
    The report generating module is responsible for generating organized and thorough reports from the audio conversations recorded during patient's visit. The important aspects of medical data (such as the symptoms, illness history, etc.) is extracted from the conversation which is then compiled into the report using this module.

    Potential Hazards:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Data inaccuracy: Misinterpretation of a medical term from the audio conversation
        \item Formatting issues
        \item System crash while generating the report
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Transcription Module:}
    The transcription module is responsible for converting audio data from the conversation to written text. The converted written text is used thereafter used by the report generation module to generate the report of the patient.

    Potential Hazards:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Background noise disruption
        \item Failure to use correct punctuation for non-verbal signs such as a sigh or pause
        \item Autocorrect failure after rephrasing the word in audio input
    \end{itemize}
    
\end{itemize}


\section{Critical Assumptions}

The following assumptions are made regarding both the software and hardware components of the system:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Stable Network Connection:} It is assumed that the network connection between the client and server will be stable. If the connection is unstable, it could cause interruptions to the process, which results in significant issues in the system’s performance.
        
    \item \textbf{Reliable Hardware:} It is assumed that there won’t be any major hardware failures. Although hardware problems are rare, they could severely affect system availability and accuracy, especially in critical healthcare environment.
\end{itemize}

\section{Safety and Security Requirements}

\begin{itemize}
    \item[SR\refstepcounter{srnum}\thesrnum \label{SR_ErrorDetection}:] The system should provide real-time error detection based on validation checks and provide feedback to users.
    \textbf{Rationale:}To prevent user errors and incorrect output it is vital to check errors induced by the user input. Moreover, in the event of an error, the system should communicate its current state, how the input has been interpreted, and any related errors to the user.
    
    \item [SR\refstepcounter{srnum}\thesrnum \label{SR_DuplicateRecordDetection}:] The system should provide duplicate record detection and prevention for patients, healthcare professionals, and healthcare network records.
    \textbf{Rationale:} To prevent confusion and medical errors resulting from duplicate entries, the system should validate and flag potential duplicate records before they are created.

    \item [SR\refstepcounter{srnum}\thesrnum \label{SR_BackNoiseFilter}:] The system should be able to filter the background noise to capture the medical data from the audio conversation between the patient and healthcare professional only.
    \textbf{Rationale:} To prevent data inaccuracy with addition of unwanted information in the report.

    \item [SR\refstepcounter{srnum}\thesrnum \label{SR_CompilingVerification}:] The system should provide validation that the text can be compiled by the report generating module as audio is being transcribed to the written text.
    \textbf{Rationale:} To identify technical errors in the beginning itself. However, in the event of any error, the system should be able to fix it without causing delay in the transcription process. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Access Requirements}
\textbf{ACR1}: The API Module (OAuth) must allow only authenticated users access to system resources. Failed authentication attempts must be logged.

\noindent \textbf{ACR2}: Only authorized personnel can create, update, or delete user accounts. Unauthorized actions should be blocked and logged.

\subsection{Integrity Requirements}
\textbf{IR1}: User credentials must remain intact during authentication. Failed login attempts should not affect the system's functionality or stored data.
