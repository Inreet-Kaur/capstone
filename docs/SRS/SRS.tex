\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Purpose of Document}

  The purpose of this document is to provide a comprehensive description of the requirements for a software application that aims to streamline the healthcare documentation process aimed to be run as a web application. This document will be used in as a contract in a sense between the team and the client who intends to use this application. This document will allow for an in-depth description of the software's functionality, performance, and other non-functional requirements. Additionally, it will outline common use-cases under which the software will be used. This will in turn provide a direction to the developers such that they will be empowered to creating the right product as this document will contain various stakeholders' requirements.\\

  Along with development direction, this document will be a direct reference for all of the stakeholders to understand the product's scope, functionality, and limitations. Additionally, this document will be a method of communication between the developers and stakeholders (domain experts, client, etc.) to ensure that the developers will be building the right product. This will ensure a feedback loop is established to allow for the development of a product that will satisfy the needs of the stakeholders and if project needs change it will be relayed through this document.


\subsection{Characteristics of Intended Reader} \label{sec_IntendedReader} 

The intended readers of this SRS document include project managers, software developers, testing engineers, and stakeholders directly involved in the design and implementation of the software system. Project managers and testing engineers would be directly involved in the development and testing process. They would generally have an education in computer science along with experience in software design, web or mobile development, and software testing. Project managers generally have experience in managing software projects and knowledge of software development processes. Stakeholders like doctors and nursing staff would have domain knowledge and could provide insights to understand the clinical workflow and documentation process. 

\subsection{Scope of Requirements} 


\subsubsection{Context Overall Objective}
Ontario is facing an extreme shortage of family doctors, with the number of
patients without one jumping by 600,000 to 2.5 million which is a growing
number [1]. This situation is only to get worse as predicted by the Ontario
Medical Association [2]. As a result, people find themselves going to the ER with
coughs and colds and flooding the ER causing massive wait times which ends in
patients even resulting in leaving without being seen [3]. A massive part of the
wait time is due to the overhead of documentation tasks. Doctors, healthcare
professionals, and support staff find themselves spending most of their time on
documentation which overall slows the pipeline of patients tremendously.

\subsubsection{Expected Benefits}
The expected benefits of this project are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Reduced documentation overhead time
  \item Increased patient throughput
  \item Improved patient care
  \item Increased doctor and healthcare professional satisfaction
\end{itemize}

Much like how copilot is a tool for programmers, the aim is to create a tool for healthcare professionals to help with documentation such that the number of patient processed per day can be increased, and the focus of doctors and nurses can be shifted from documentation to patient care. 

\subsubsection{Goals}
The goals for this project are as follows:
\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{p{4cm} p{4cm} p{4cm}}

        \midrule
        G1: Use voice to fill in medical documentation (charts, files, etc.) & The app will record conversations and automatically turn them into medical notes and charts. & This will save doctors time by automating paperwork, letting them focus more on patients. \\
        \midrule
        G2: Reduce documentation overhead time.  & Through tracking the whole patient journey in the app, we look to reduce the overhead of triaging, clinical documentation, and other registrations.  & This helps hospital healthcare professionals focus on care and lowers the time taken through registration for hospital staff. \\ 
        \midrule
        G3: Compliant with data security standards.  & Patient data will flow through the app therefore the app must abide by privacy laws and privacy standards. & This will give healthcare organizations confidence in the application and will give patients peace of mind that their information is safe. \\
        \midrule 
        G4: Ease of integration with the existing hospital environment. & We want the solution to be portable such that it can be implemented in existing hospital and clinic ecosystems.  & Portability will ensure that hospitals and clinics won’t have to upgrade their existing hardware to use the application. \\
        \midrule 
        G5: Ease of use. & The app will be designed so that healthcare professionals of all skill levels can use it without any difficulty. & A simple, intuitive interface ensures users can quickly learn and use the app, allowing them to spend more time on patient care rather than managing the system. \\

\subsubsection{Risks and Mitigation}

Looking at implementation details there are a few risks that come up, if these risks can be addressed or have a clearer roadmap that will make us more confident in the project. 

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Speech Input} -- A hospital or a clinic can be a loud place, in the event audio input is taken we need to ensure that it is clean and clear. This would mean essentially blocking outside noise. 
  \item \textbf{Visual Inputs} -- If any old charts need to be inputted into the patient journey having the ability to scan and transfer the information into the required format will be another risk. The document needs to be rid of noisy data.
  \item \textbf{Pre-Trained Models} -- To manipulate and use both inputs above we need to create a model to be accurate and provide accuracy when filling in charts. 
  \item \textbf{Data Privacy} -- This application will hold a lot of patient data so creating a store that is secure and making sure standard data security practice is applied is a must.
  \item \textbf{User Acceptance} -- This will require further elicitation from outside supervisors. We need to gather data on what critical needs of healthcare professionals such that critical features are present.
  \item \textbf{Technical Delay} – Integration with Electronic Health record systems might cause some delays if there’s any technical issue or if the software faces compatibility issues. This will require sample testing to make sure that the software is compatible in the early stage of the development process.
  \item \textbf{Professional Verification} – Misinterpretation of some words might lead to inaccurate records and wrong diagnosis. Therefore, it’s important for the doctor/nurse to verify the final version of the document and manually delete anything that was falsely recorded. 
\end{itemize}
