\section{Specific System Description} \label{sec_SpecificSystemDescription}


\subsection{Problem Description} \label{sec_ProblemDescription}

Ontario is facing an extreme shortage of family doctors, with the number of patients without one jumping by 600,000 to 2.5 million which is a growing number [1]. This situation is only to get worse as predicted by the Ontario Medical Association [2]. As a result, people find themselves going to the ER with coughs and colds and flooding the ER causing massive wait times which ends in patients even resulting in leaving without being seen [3]. A massive part of the wait time is due to the overhead of documentation tasks. Doctors, healthcare professionals, and support staff find themselves spending most of their time on documentation which overall slows the pipeline of patients tremendously.

  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{use-case.drawio.png}
  \caption{This is the use-case diagram for this scenario.}
  \label{fig:Use-Case Diagram}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Usage Scenario 1: Documenting a Patient Consultation}

\begin{itemize}
  \item\textbf{Use Case:} UC2, UC3
  \item\textbf{Primary Actor:} Healthcare professional (such as a medical doctor or a nurse)
  \item\textbf{Precondition:} The user has been successfully authenticated, logged into the system and has patientâ€™s profile is created. The basic information such as name, contact information, and history is prefilled.
  \item\textbf{Trigger:} The user will press the dictate button.
  \item\textbf{Main Success Scenario:}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The user will press the dictate button.
    \item The system will convert audio to text in real-time.
    \item The user will press stop button.
    \item The user reviews the transcribed notes. 
    \item The system has accurately transcribed the audio to text without any inaccuracies.
    \item The user selects the submit button after review. 
  \end{itemize}
  \item\textbf{Secondary Success Scenario:}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The system has produced some inaccuracies in the transcribed text.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item The user selects the edit button.
      \item The system prompts user to edit the text.
      \item The user manually edits the transcribed text.
    \end{itemize} 
  \end{itemize}
  \item\textbf{Success Postcondition:}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The notes are successfully saved in patient database and changes are reflected in the user interface.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Risks and Mitigation}

Looking at implementation details there are a few risks that come up, if these risks can be addressed or have a clearer roadmap that will make us more confident in the project. 

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Speech Input:} A hospital or a clinic can be a loud place, in the event audio input is taken we need to ensure that it is clean and clear. This would mean essentially blocking outside noise. 
  \item \textbf{Pre-Trained Models:} To manipulate and use both inputs above we need to create a model to be accurate and provide accuracy when filling in charts. 
  \item \textbf{User Acceptance:} This will require further elicitation from outside supervisors. We need to gather data on what critical needs of healthcare professionals such that critical features are present.
  \item \textbf{Technical Delay:} Integration with EHR systems might cause some delays if thereâ€™s any technical issue or if the software faces compatibility issues. This will require sample testing to make sure that the system is compatible in the early stage of the development process.
  \item \textbf{Professional Verification:} Misinterpretation of some words might lead to inaccurate records and wrong diagnosis. Therefore, itâ€™s important for the healthcare professionals to verify the final version of the document and manually delete anything that was falsely recorded. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Requirements} \label{sec_Requirements}


\subsection{Functional Requirements} \label{sec_FunctionalRequirements}


\noindent \begin{itemize}

\item[FR\refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum \label{FR_meaningfulLabel}:] 

\textbf{Requirement:} The system should allow to add healthcare network to the system. 

\textbf{Rationale:} Rapid care is an organizational tool, where networks can register their various hospitals, and in turn add the corresponding health care professionals. When the networks want to register, the app needs to be able to add the network to the database along with the relevant staff profiles etc.

\textbf{Fit Criterion:} The network data and profiles are fully added to the database. This could be verified by returning the valid entries from the patient database.

\textbf{Dependencies:} N/A

\textbf{Monitored and Controlled Variables:} N/A

\textbf{Performance Requirements:} 
\begin{itemize}
  \item The system should update the entries with the latency of 1 second.
  \item After user input is taken the system only adds valid entries to the database and prevents any data leaks.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Hardware Requirements:} 
\begin{itemize}
  \item Workstations and other peripherals to access the system.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Software Requirements:} 
\begin{itemize}
  \item Database management system to store health network data.
  \item Internet browser to access the application.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Normal Behavior:} 
\begin{itemize}
  \item All input data is validated as being entered into the system.
  \item Once all required fields are completed the user selects the submit button and the network is added successfully to the system.
  \item The process should have a low turnover time such that health networks will not have to spend a long time waiting to use the system.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Undesired Event Handling:} 
\begin{itemize}
  \item The user may enter invalid input data. The system should display appropriate error messages. 
  \item The system should have constraints to restrict the user from submitting, unless all required fields are completed and have valid input data. 
  \item When the database is overloaded with requests, appropriate error messages should be delayed. 
  \item The updates will be queued to prevent this in the future, data resources will be scaled just so that the calls are faster. This will include indexing or caching and scaling the solution horizontally to balance the load.
\end{itemize}


\item[FR\refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum \label{FR_meaningfulLabel}:]  

\textbf{Requirement:} The system should allow to remove a health network from the system.

\textbf{Rationale:} 
When health networks close and want to pivot to another documentation tool their data and profiles must be deleted. Therefore, there is a requirement for functionality that allows organizations to deregister and have their data deleted.

\textbf{Fit Criterion:} 
The network data and profiles are fully deleted from the database. This could be verified by returning the valid entries from the patient database.

\textbf{Dependencies:} 3.1.1

\textbf{Monitored and Controlled Variables:} N/A
