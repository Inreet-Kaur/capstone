\wss{The intention of the VnV plan is to increase confidence in the software.
However, this does not mean listing every verification and validation technique
that has ever been devised.  The VnV plan should also be a \textbf{feasible}
plan. Execution of the plan should be possible with the time and team available.
If the full plan cannot be completed during the time available, it can either be
modified to ``fake it'', or a better solution is to add a section describing
what work has been completed and what work is still planned for the future.}

\wss{The VnV plan is typically started after the requirements stage, but before
the design stage.  This means that the sections related to unit testing cannot
initially be completed.  The sections will be filled in after the design stage
is complete.  the final version of the VnV plan should have all sections filled
in.}

  Verification and Validation plan}

\section{General Information}

\subsection{Summary}

This document provides a comprehensive description of the system tests specific to all requirements for a software application, RapidCare, that aims to streamline the healthcare documentation process aimed to be run as a web application. This document will be used as a verification tool to ensure that system fulfills all the requirements and needs of the user. This document will allow for an in-depth description of system tests for functional, non-functional, safety and security requirements. Additionally, it will outline the verification plan for design and implementation which will make sure that all requirements are fulfilled. Along with this, the document will also include the software validation plan that will validate the requirements by making sure that the client who intends to use this application is satisfied with its features.    

\subsection{Objectives}

The objective of verification and validation plan is to build confidence in the correctness of the software and decide if the software is correctly following the requirements. Additionally, we want to achieve adequate usability of our software by making sure it satisfies with the user's needs, thus speeding up the documentation process. Another goal of this document is to test the accuracy of the input data to reflect that the software suggests correct diagnosis based on the written text that has been transcribed from the audio conversation. Assuming that the external libraries are already tested by their implementation team, the priority of this document will be to test the requirements of the software to ease the patient care. Due to time constraints and limited resources, we are not going to test the quality of usability. While the usability is important to test, the priority of this document is to test the fundamental requirements to ensure the software is accuarate and reliable. 

\subsection{Challenge Level and Extras}

In terms of the project challenge level, the project will come in the general category. The reasoning for this choice is supported below:

\begin{itemize}
  \item\textbf{Domain Knowledge}-- The documentation process has a lot of ins and outs which may differ between health organizations. Our supervisors and stakeholders will provide us with a base of the requirements, but further elicitation will be required to ensure that the requirements reflect a problem that truly exists. Additionally, since the whole patient journey is tracked we will have to survey other hospital staff as well to gain a further understanding. 
  \item\textbf{Implementation Challenges}-- There will be quite a few microservices required for this project where each microservice has high complexity. The performance of the microservices must be high as this use case requires quick response time. Additionally, since we are dealing with patient data security and privacy must be upheld. Lastly, the integration between all of the parts must be secure and undergo rigorous integration testing.
\end{itemize}

As part of the extras for this project, we will accomplish the following extras:

\begin{itemize}
  \item\textbf{Usability testing}-- This is designed for the users to assess how easily they can navigate and use the software. This will ensure that the requirements of the software perfectly align with the user's needs.
  \item\textbf{User documentation}-- This will include instructions that will help the user to get started with the software. It will have an overview of the software along with some help resources for setup instructions and easy navigation for the user.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Relevant Documentation}

The documents that are relevant to this project are SRS, Hazard Analysis, MG and MIS. SRS and Hazard Analysis documents lists the FR, NFR, safety and security requirements which will assist us in developing tests for each of them. Moreover, MG and MIS documents give a structured approach of system's architecture and interface, ensuring that the system is thoroughly tested. This will help us to develop test cases for vital areas of the software.  

\section{Plan}

\wss{Introduce this section.  You can provide a roadmap of the sections to
  come.}

\subsection{Verification and Validation Team}

\wss{Your teammates.  Maybe your supervisor.
  You should do more than list names.  You should say what each person's role is
  for the project's verification.  A table is a good way to summarize this information.}

\subsection{SRS Verification Plan}

\wss{List any approaches you intend to use for SRS verification.  This may
  include ad hoc feedback from reviewers, like your classmates (like your
  primary reviewer), or you may plan for something more rigorous/systematic.}

\wss{If you have a supervisor for the project, you shouldn't just say they will
read over the SRS.  You should explain your structured approach to the review.
Will you have a meeting?  What will you present?  What questions will you ask?
Will you give them instructions for a task-based inspection?  Will you use your
issue tracker?}

\wss{Maybe create an SRS checklist?}

\subsection{Design Verification Plan}

\wss{Plans for design verification}

\wss{The review will include reviews by your classmates}

\wss{Create a checklists?}

\subsection{Verification and Validation Plan Verification Plan}

\wss{The verification and validation plan is an artifact that should also be
verified.  Techniques for this include review and mutation testing.}

\wss{The review will include reviews by your classmates}

\wss{Create a checklists?}

\subsection{Implementation Verification Plan}

\wss{You should at least point to the tests listed in this document and the unit
  testing plan.}

\wss{In this section you would also give any details of any plans for static
  verification of the implementation.  Potential techniques include code
  walkthroughs, code inspection, static analyzers, etc.}

\wss{The final class presentation in CAS 741 could be used as a code
walkthrough.  There is also a possibility of using the final presentation (in
CAS741) for a partial usability survey.}

\subsection{Automated Testing and Verification Tools}

\wss{What tools are you using for automated testing.  Likely a unit testing
  framework and maybe a profiling tool, like ValGrind.  Other possible tools
  include a static analyzer, make, continuous integration tools, test coverage
  tools, etc.  Explain your plans for summarizing code coverage metrics.
  Linters are another important class of tools.  For the programming language
  you select, you should look at the available linters.  There may also be tools
  that verify that coding standards have been respected, like flake9 for
  Python.}

\wss{If you have already done this in the development plan, you can point to
that document.}

\wss{The details of this section will likely evolve as you get closer to the
  implementation.}

\subsection{Software Validation Plan}

\wss{If there is any external data that can be used for validation, you should
  point to it here.  If there are no plans for validation, you should state that
  here.}

\wss{You might want to use review sessions with the stakeholder to check that
the requirements document captures the right requirements.  Maybe task based
inspection?}

\wss{For those capstone teams with an external supervisor, the Rev 0 demo should 
be used as an opportunity to validate the requirements.  You should plan on 
demonstrating your project to your supervisor shortly after the scheduled Rev 0 demo.  
The feedback from your supervisor will be very useful for improving your project.}

\wss{For teams without an external supervisor, user testing can serve the same purpose 
as a Rev 0 demo for the supervisor.}

\wss{This section might reference back to the SRS verification section.}

\section{System Tests}

\wss{There should be text between all headings, even if it is just a roadmap of
the contents of the subsections.}

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

\wss{Subsets of the tests may be in related, so this section is divided into
  different areas.  If there are no identifiable subsets for the tests, this
  level of document structure can be removed.}

\wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below
  cover the requirements.  References to the SRS would be good here.}

\subsubsection{Area of Testing1}

\wss{It would be nice to have a blurb here to explain why the subsections below
  cover the requirements.  References to the SRS would be good here.  If a section
  covers tests for input constraints, you should reference the data constraints
  table in the SRS.}

\subsection{Unit Testing Scope}

\wss{What modules are outside of the scope.  If there are modules that are
  developed by someone else, then you would say here if you aren't planning on
  verifying them.  There may also be modules that are part of your software, but
  have a lower priority for verification than others.  If this is the case,
  explain your rationale for the ranking of module importance.}

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

\wss{Most of the verification will be through automated unit testing.  If
  appropriate specific modules can be verified by a non-testing based
  technique.  That can also be documented in this section.}

\subsubsection{Module 1}

\wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below cover the module.
  References to the MIS would be good.  You will want tests from a black box
  perspective and from a white box perspective.  Explain to the reader how the
  tests were selected.}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{test-id1\\}

Type: \wss{Functional, Dynamic, Manual, Automatic, Static etc. Most will
  be automatic}
					
Initial State: 
					
Input: 
					
Output: \wss{The expected result for the given inputs}

Test Case Derivation: \wss{Justify the expected value given in the Output field}

How test will be performed: 
					
\item{test-id2\\}

Type: \wss{Functional, Dynamic, Manual, Automatic, Static etc. Most will
  be automatic}
					
Initial State: 
					
Input: 
					
Output: \wss{The expected result for the given inputs}

Test Case Derivation: \wss{Justify the expected value given in the Output field}

How test will be performed:

\section{Appendix}

This is where you can place additional information.

\subsection{Symbolic Parameters}

The definition of the test cases will call for SYMBOLIC\_CONSTANTS.
Their values are defined in this section for easy maintenance.

\subsection{Usability Survey Questions?}

\wss{This is a section that would be appropriate for some projects.}

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

\wss{This section is not required for CAS 741}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Lifelong Learning.

\input{../Reflection.tex}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What went well while writing this deliverable? 
  \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?
  \item What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to
  successfully complete the verification and validation of your project?
  Examples of possible knowledge and skills include dynamic testing knowledge,
  static testing knowledge, specific tool usage, Valgrind etc.  You should look to
  identify at least one item for each team member.
  \item For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous
  question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or
  mastering the skill?  Of the identified approaches, which will each team
  member pursue, and why did they make this choice?
\end{enumerate}
