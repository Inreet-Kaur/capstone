\section{Problem Statement}

\wss{You should check your problem statement with the
\href{https://github.com/smiths/capTemplate/blob/main/docs/Checklists/ProbState-Checklist.pdf}
{problem statement checklist}.} 

\wss{You can change the section headings, as long as you include the required
information.}

\subsection{Problem}

Ontario is facing an extreme shortage of family doctors, the number of patients without one jumping by 600 000 to 2.5 million which is a growing number [1]. This situation is only to get worse as predicted by the Ontario Medical Association [2]. As a result, people find themselves going to the ER with coughs and colds and flooding ER causing massive wait times which ends in patients even resulting in leaving without being seen [3]. A massive part of the wait time is due to the overhead of documentation tasks. Doctors, health care professionals, and support staff find themselves spending most of their time on documentation which overall slows pipeline of patients tremendously.

\subsection{Inputs and Outputs}

\wss{Characterize the problem in terms of ``high level'' inputs and outputs.  
Use abstraction so that you can avoid details.}

\subsection{Stakeholders}

This project will include many stakeholders from developers, visionaries, supervisors, as well as adopters. Below are the stakeholders concerned with this project.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Application Users}: These users will include the healthcare staff in the hospital using the application to speed up documentation throughout the patient journey. This will include receptionists, nurses, doctors as well as any other hospital members responsible with patient documentations. They will be the primary users as they are the target group whose time is most used up in patient documentation tasks.
    \item \textbf{Development Team}: This is the team of developers who will be implementing the solution. They will take whateverâ€™s in the backlog and implement it as per the requirements into a functional and user-friendly application. This team will also include product owners as well as product managers who will turn the vision into a prioritized backlog. This will ensure the customers needs are fulfilled in a systematic and agile fashion.
    \item \textbf{Project Supervisors}: These will include domain experts as well as potential users such as physicians. Project supervisors will be critical in envisioning the app. Namely assisting with requirements elicitation as well as helping in formulating functional and non-functional requirements. As members of the field, they are able to provide, review and give feedback on critical pain points and give feedback on the features to relieve the pain points.
    \item \textbf{Application Clients}: The bodies themselves that will purchase the software, in other words this essentially the health systems. These health systems will essentially plug this system into their network of hospitals where health care professionals can use this software.
    \item \textbf{Regulatory Bodies}: These are bodies that regulate patient health data. Since the whole patient journey will be tracked through the application abiding by security and privacy policy is a must. Examples of these bodies and would be governments through policy, information and privacy commissions.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Environment}

\wss{Hardware and software environment}

The application is meant to be run on a computer with standard specifications as complex graphics are not required. Sample specifications on the computer may look like Intel i3, 8 Gb ram, 256 gB SSD. The application will be meant for Windows as through elicitation that is the standard operating systems used in hospitals. As per the environment the apps services will run in, that would be a cloud provider (AWS, GCP, Azure). 

\section{Goals}

\section{Stretch Goals}

\section{Challenge Level and Extras}

\wss{State your expected challenge level (advanced, general or basic).  The
challenge can come through the required domain knowledge, the implementation or
something else.  Usually the greater the novelty of a project the greater its
challenge level.  You should include your rationale for the selected level.
Approval of the level will be part of the discussion with the instructor for
approving the project.  The challenge level, with the approval (or request) of
the instructor, can be modified over the course of the term.}

\wss{Teams may wish to include extras as either potential bonus grades, or to
make up for a less advanced challenge level.  Potential extras include usability
testing, code walkthroughs, user documentation, formal proof, GenderMag
personas, Design Thinking, etc.  Normally the maximum number of extras will be
two.  Approval of the extras will be part of the discussion with the instructor
for approving the project.  The extras, with the approval (or request) of the
instructor, can be modified over the course of the term.}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item What went well while writing this deliverable? 
    \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?
    \item How did you and your team adjust the scope of your goals to ensure
    they are suitable for a Capstone project (not overly ambitious but also of
    appropriate complexity for a senior design project)?
