\section{Problem Statement}

\wss{You should check your problem statement with the
\href{https://github.com/smiths/capTemplate/blob/main/docs/Checklists/ProbState-Checklist.pdf}
{problem statement checklist}.} 

\wss{You can change the section headings, as long as you include the required
information.}

\subsection{Problem}

\subsection{Inputs and Outputs}

\wss{Characterize the problem in terms of ``high level'' inputs and outputs.  
Use abstraction so that you can avoid details.}

Inputs for this project will be the following:

\begin{itemize}
    \item textbf{Doctor-Patient Conversation}: They are the stored information of the conversation between the medical staff and the patient that contains information such as patient’s personal history, their disease history, current treatment among others.
    \item textbf{Common Diseases List}: This comprises features such as symptoms and treatment/diagnosis using machine learning algorithms.
    \item textbf{Voice Profiles}: Voice profiles that can be specific for doctors and patients will enable them to be recognized for the chart filled out accordingly. 
\end {itemize}

Outputs for this project will be the following: 

\begin{itemize} 
    \item textbf{Triage information}: The subjects involve triage data entry from the recorded conversation with the aim of enhancing documentation process within the emergency department.
    \item textbf{Auto-filled documents}: The documentation process will be done according to the conversation which will be recorded and then transcribed to electronic means for filing in the patient’s profile.
    \item textbf{Alerts for Medical Staff}: In case of any priority cases the alert will be sent to the doctor, especially in the emergency department, based on the symptoms mentioned for treatment.
\end{itemize}

\section{Goals}

\section{Stretch Goals}

\section{Challenge Level and Extras}

\wss{State your expected challenge level (advanced, general or basic).  The
challenge can come through the required domain knowledge, the implementation or
something else.  Usually the greater the novelty of a project the greater its
challenge level.  You should include your rationale for the selected level.
Approval of the level will be part of the discussion with the instructor for
approving the project.  The challenge level, with the approval (or request) of
the instructor, can be modified over the course of the term.}

\wss{Teams may wish to include extras as either potential bonus grades, or to
make up for a less advanced challenge level.  Potential extras include usability
testing, code walkthroughs, user documentation, formal proof, GenderMag
personas, Design Thinking, etc.  Normally the maximum number of extras will be
two.  Approval of the extras will be part of the discussion with the instructor
for approving the project.  The extras, with the approval (or request) of the
instructor, can be modified over the course of the term.}

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

\wss{Not required for CAS 741}

\input{../Reflection.tex}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item What went well while writing this deliverable? 
    \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?
    \item How did you and your team adjust the scope of your goals to ensure
    they are suitable for a Capstone project (not overly ambitious but also of
    appropriate complexity for a senior design project)?
