\maketitle

This document summarizes the contributions of each team member up to the POC
Demo.  The time period of interest is the time between the beginning of the term
and the POC demo.

\section{Demo Plans}

% \wss{What will you be demonstrating}

The main risk of the project is related to the reduction of documentation overhead. This means the biggest risk is really if this project can make a significant reduction to overhead time and truly reduce patient wait times. Again, through elicitation and our domain experts, we will create an effective set of requirements to reduce the risk of the project and build something that is needed.\\

Looking at implementation details there are a few risks that come up, if these risks can be addressed or have a clearer roadmap that will make us more confident in the project. 

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Speech Input} -- A hospital or a clinic can be a loud place, in the event audio input is taken we need to ensure that it is clean and clear. This would mean essentially blocking outside noise.
  \item \textbf{Pre-Trained Models} -- To manipulate and use both inputs above we need to create a model to be accurate and provide accuracy when filling in charts. 
  \item \textbf{Data Privacy} -- This application will hold a lot of patient data so creating a store that is secure and making sure standard data security practice is applied is a must.
  \item \textbf{User Acceptance} -- This will require further elicitation outside supervisors. We need to gather data on what critical needs of healthcare professionals such that critical features are present. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Team Meeting Attendance}

% \wss{For each team member how many team meetings have they attended over the
% time period of interest.  This number should be determined from the meeting
% issues in the team's repo.  The first entry in the table should be the total
% number of team meetings held by the team.}

\section{Supervisor/Stakeholder Meeting Attendance}

% \wss{For each team member how many supervisor/stakeholder team meetings have
% they attended over the time period of interest.  This number should be determined
% from the supervisor meeting issues in the team's repo.  The first entry in the
% table should be the total number of supervisor and team meetings held by the
% team.  If there is no supervisor, there will usually be meetings with
% stakeholders (potential users) that can serve a similar purpose.}

% \wss{If needed, an explanation for the counts can be provided here.}
We have recently found a new supervisor. Gurleen Rahi had an first in-person meeting to pitch our idea and to the supervisor. We have now setup a biweekly check-in meeting in order to discuss our progress. We have also setup an in-person meeting at the clinic to get to know more about the environment we are dealing with and learn more about the current systems. 

\section{Lecture Attendance}

% \wss{For each team member how many lectures have they attended over the time
% period of interest.  This number should be determined from the lecture issues in
% the team's repo.  The first entry in the table should be the total number of
% lectures since the beginning of the term.}

\section{Commits}

% \wss{For each team member how many commits to the main branch have been made

% instance, if a team member has more commits to unmerged branches, these numbers
% can be provided here.  If multiple people contribute to a commit, git allows for
% multi-author commits.}

\section{Issue Tracker}

% \wss{For each team member how many issues have they authored (including open and
