The project aims to speed up the documentation process for healthcare professionals in turn streamlining the medical process. Through preliminary elicitation we have found doctors spend the most time on documentation. We aim to create an application that can record the voice of conversations and then transcribe it into text. The transcribed data will then be used to fill out patient charts. In addition to this, the system will also provide insights on frequent diagnosis and medicines using this data. This will also be applied in the triage process meaning the whole patient journey will be sped up.

The folders and files for this project are as follows:

- docs - Documentation for the project
