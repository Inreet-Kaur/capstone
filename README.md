This project is ...

The project aims to speed up the documentation process for healthcare professionals in turn streamlining the medical process. Through preliminary elicitation we have found doctors spend the most time on documentation. We aim to create an application that can record the voice of conversations using existing dictation devices to fill out charts etc.. Then on the conversation insights on frequent diagnosis and corresponding medicines can be seen as well. This will also be applied in the triage process meaning the whole patient journey will be sped up.
